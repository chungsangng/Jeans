Here are the files for the codes and outputs for the results published in  C. S. Ng, and A. Bhattacharjee, Landau Modes are Eigenmodes of Stellar Systems in the Limit of Zero Collisions, 
Astrophys. J., 923, 271 (2021), Doi: 10.3847/1538-4357/ac31ae.

The Fortran program files all end with .f. The outputs from these programs end with .txt and begin with (after the figure number) the same names as the programs that produce them. 
Input parameters are listed in the beginning of each output files. The figure number before a file indicate data corresponding to the figure presented in the above paper.
IDL scripts end with .idl are used to produce figures using data files begin with the same names.
